      <h3>Lemon</h3>
      <p>Words can't express my lemon<br>
        good thing that life gave it out.<br>
        Done more miles than Magellan<br>
        still sees me through - round about.<br>
        <br>
        The door crushed me whe it slammed<br>
        but time's wheels must keep spinning.<br>
        Like your mixtape that's still jammed<br>
        I'm back to the beginning.<br>
        <br>
        There's no sign of where to go<br>
        guess I'm along for the ride.<br>
        I'll just press down low and slow.<br>
        use a new light as my guide.<br>
    </p>

      <h3>Nuclear Family</h3>
      <p>
        Family is a funny word<br>
        the concept is a bit absurd.<br>
        Paying back a debt incurred<br>
        with love that's better seen than heard.<br>
        <br>
        Did I sign on family lines?<br>
        I always end up in these binds.<br>
        Forever too green on the vines<br>
        To understand these blood confines.<br>
        <br>
        Economically speaking<br>
        with all the havoc that we're wreaking.<br>
        Is progeny worth seeking?<br>
        These thoughts keep my interest piquing.<br>
        <br>
        Family's so nuclear<br>
        a phenomenon peculiar.<br>
        Rookie bioengineers<br>
        humanity's so cavalier.<br>
        <br>
        Life wasn't on my wish list<br>
        Domestic bliss doesn't exist<br>
        Is there something that I missed<br>
        A reason for genes to persit.<br>
        <br>
        Sorry dear old mom and dad<br>
        existing isn't all that bad<br>
        just think children were a fad<br>
        there's noone left for me to add.<br>
    </p>

      <h3>Temporary Files</h3>
      <p> 
        Oh gosh it's your birthday<br>
        why can't I forget?<br>
        My memory's waylaid<br>
        my conscious again.<br>
        <br>
        I wrote you off, <br>
        unsubscribed,<br>
        and wiped your data clean.<br>
        Surely the thought's a GDPR breach.<br>
        <br>
        If you were a file<br>
        I'd right-click delete.<br>
        Are you sure? it would ask me.<br>
        I wouldn't even blink.<br>
        <br>
        Can't seem to delete you;<br>
        what am I to do?<br>
        Are you stuck in my head<br>
        til the day that I'm dead?<br>
        <br>
        You're hogging my disc space<br>
        you utter disgrace.<br>
        Yes, you total utter disgrace!<br>
        <br>
        Now I'll reboot and remove<br>
        those temporary files;<br>
        and corrupt your mixtape<br>
        that I've played for miles.<br>
        <br>
        I'll upgrade my memories with somebody new.<br>
        Defragment my heart-drive <br>
        make my dreams come true.<br>
        <br>
        If life is a network<br>
        don't connect to mine.<br>
        Unless you know what love is<br>
        I won't give a dime.<br>
        <br>
        Last week was your birthday<br>
        and it slipped my mind <br>
        yes it totally slipped my mind.<br>

      </p>
    <h3>Double Yellow Lines</h3>
        <p>
        They say life's like a highway<br>
        but then why am I so low.<br>
        Kept staring forward to one day<br>
        No two ever in a row.<br>
        <br>
        Am I tresspassing through?<br>
        I've paid the trolls my fare.<br>
        The road to home it never queues<br>
        God don't divert me there.<br>
        <br>
        These double yellow lines<br>
        they paint between your place and mine;<br>
        No stopping waiting or overtaking<br>
        allowed at any time.<br>
        <br>
        So you just keep on to the left<br>
        and I'll keep to the right.<br>
        When breathing deep feels just like theft<br>
        love's never black and white.<br>
        <br>
        Does a rose that grows so far away<br>
        even still have a smell?<br>
        They've levied me my Chevrolet<br>
        Now I drive a blue Vauxhall<br>
        <br>
        Those lines are drawn with thick red tape<br>
        they blare: "you shall not pass!"<br>
        I dream of making our escape<br>
        until we run out of gas.<br>
        <br>
        Those double yellow lines<br>
        Those double yellow lines<br>
        We'll have to learn to roll in our hay<br>
        while the sun still shines.<br>
        <br>
        Those double yellow lines<br>
        Those double yellow lines<br>
        One day I hope to cut across<br>
        without incurring any fines<br>

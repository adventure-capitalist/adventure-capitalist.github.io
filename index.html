      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I was born in the USA and lived there until I was sixteen. Then I packed my bags and headed to Europe and I haven't looked back. 
        I am passionate about speaking to people and learning about their perspectives. 
        I can sometimes be found playing the cornet in various towns and villages across Surrey and Hampshire. 
        When I'm not doing that, I'm almost certainly huddling around a cup of coffee, either freelance translating or learning new skills on my quest to join the world of web development.
        I am the proud guardian of three lovely pet rats, who I have trained (bribed) to do a few different tricks in exchange for sweet corn. 
        I'm eager to make an impact in a supportive and uplifting environment, and I can't wait to see what is just around the bend.</p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>As a military child, I bounced around a bit during school. 
        Our family ended up in Michigan where, in 2011, I graduated from Midland High School after having spent an eventful few years spent playing soccer, running cross-country, and performing in the marching band. 
        Looking back, it's hard to imagine how I had so much energy! 
        During my senior year, I was awarded a scholarship by the Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange program to study abroad in Germany, and I gladly took up the opportunity. 
        I packed my bags, applied for my first passport and spent a year of my life both honing my German skills and embracing the sights and sounds of Europe. 
        Three years later I was graduating cum laude from Carthage College with a BA in International Political Economy and a minor in German Language. 
        Subsequently I studied International Comparative Sociology at the University of Kiel, until the school hired me as an English translator. 
        I started researching MA courses in Translation Studies and before I knew it, the very next year I was handing in my dissertation at the University of Portsmouth and looking for my first real job.
        Little did I know that only three years into my career I would be back in night school in London trying furiously to uncover the mysteries of computer science.</p>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>During high school I worked for a popular fast food restaurant as soon as I turned 14, but after returning from my year abroad, I approached a local business for opportunities relating to my unique German language skills.
        My boldness soon paid off as I soon landed a steady job as an Administrative Assistant at a local law firm. 
        Unfortunately, I soon had to leave to attend university, but that didn't discourage me from seeking new opportunities. 
        I quickly collected several student jobs around the university which meant by the time I had graduated, I had managed to work off nearly all of my tuition fees.
        During J-term 2012 at university, during which students are expected to attend or undertake unusual studies for the month of January, I had asked the member of German parliament that I had connected with on my year abroad if I could do an internship in his regional office. 
        Suprisingly he agreed, and I was tasked with a variety of activities surrounding supporting a busy member of parliament and his duties. 
        I enjoyed my time abroad so much that upon graduating, I spent a year studying in Germany until the University started asking me to help them translate some of their materials which is when it hit me: I should go into translation professionally. I soon found my first real life job as a Translation Project Manager at Surrey Translation Bureau where I have been now for around three years.
        For the future, I'd like to keep developing my programming skills and hopefully meet some interesting people along the way. </p>
